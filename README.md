# MobaLedLib
###Arduino library for controlling LEDs and other components on a model railway.


**New: Excel user interface to configure the LEDs without programming at all improved by the engagement of Pattern_Configurator and Program_Generator!**

To start the excel program press the Win+r key together and copy the following line
into the "Run" dialog and press enter:
  %USERPROFILE%\Documents\Arduino\libraries\Mobaledlib\extras\LEDs_AutoProg\Prog_Generator_MobaLedLib.xlsm

**The use of RGB LEDs offers fascinating possibilities for lighting a model railway:**
- **Infinite number of lighting effects** - Brightness and color of each LED can be
  set individually and dynamically
- **Easiest cabling** - The objects (houses, traffic lights, ...) are simply plugged
  into a multiple socket
- **Extremely affordable** - 100 LEDs for the price of three "normal" lights
- Up to **256 RGB LEDs (768 channels)** can be controlled by an Arduino
- Controlling other components is just as easy
  - Sound modules
  - Servo and stepper motors
  - Power devices
- Additional module to read 80 and more switches with 10 signal wires
- Stand-alone operation or networked with other components possible

The lighting and some additional functions are controlled via the WS2812 / WS2811 chips.
For this, only a single signal is required which is forwarded from one chip to the next.
This makes the wiring extremely easy.

A lot of **examples** show the usage of the library. They could be use as startup for own programs.


This library is described in detail here:

Several videos which demonstrate the library are available in the following pages in the forum
You could also search for MobaLedLib in the internet.

ATTENTION: Always use the actual Arduino IDE
(Old versions 1.6.x and below don't support the directory structure used in the library examples)


Installation from the Arduino IDE:
  Sketch / Include library / Manage libraries
  Type "MobaLedLib" in the "Filter your search..." field
  Select the entry and click "Install"


Installation in der deutschen Arduino IDE:
  Sketch / Bibliothek einbinden / Bibliothek verwalten
  "FastLED" in das "Grenzen Sie ihre Suche ein" Feld eingeben
  Gefundenen Eintrag auswaehlen und "Install" anklicken
